   * This is step #1 from the [user authentication]{@link https://developer.themoviedb.org/v4/docs/authentication-user} page.
   *
   * This method generates a new request token that you can ask a user to approve.
   * This is the first step in getting permission from a user to read and write data on their behalf.
   *
   * The next step will be to have the user approve the request token via a redirect to TMDb using the following URL:
   * {@link https://www.themoviedb.org/auth/access?request_token={request_token}}
   *
   * Where request_token is the value of the request_token you retrieved in the previous step.
   *
   * You can think of a request token as a temporary token that is waiting for the TMDB user to authorize on your behalf.
   * It serves no other purpose and cannot be used for authenticating requests.
   * Unused request tokens will automatically expire after <b>15 minutes</b>.
   *
   * * <b>ðŸ“˜ Note</b>
   *
   * An optional post  body can be added alongside this request to set a redirect URL or callback that will be executed once a request token has been approved on TMDB.
   * If no redirect is set, the user will be redirected to {@link https://www.themoviedb.org/auth/access/approve}
   *
   * @example POST Body
   * {
   *   "redirect_to": "https://www.themoviedb.org/"
